### 1. üöÄ Bulk Operations - "Edit Multiple Records At Once"

#### What It Actually Does:
- Allows you to change multiple attendance records simultaneously
- Perfect for fixing system outages, special events, or payroll corrections

#### Step-by-Step Test:
```
1. First, create test data:
   - Have employees check in/out normally
   - Or manually create records in "All Records" section

2. Go to "All Records" tab:
   - Set date range (e.g., last 7 days)
   - Click "Apply Filters & Search"
   - You should see attendance records appear

3. Return to "Bulk Operations" tab:
   - Records should still be loaded
   - Check boxes next to 2-3 records
   - Counter should show "Selected for Bulk: 3"

4. Test bulk editing:
   - Set "Check-out Time" to a future time (e.g., 6:00 PM today)
   - Add "Admin Notes": "Testing bulk edit functionality"
   - Click "Apply Bulk Changes"
   - Should see success message

5. Verify changes:
   - Go back to "All Records" and refresh
   - Selected records should have new check-out time
   - Notes should show your admin note
```

#### Real-World Example:
**Scenario**: System was down yesterday 2-5 PM, employees couldn't check out.
**Solution**: 
1. Filter records for yesterday
2. Select all affected employees
3. Set check-out time to 5:00 PM
4. Add note: "System outage recovery - actual checkout time"
5. Apply changes - everyone's hours are corrected for payroll

### 2. üéØ Force Actions - "Override Employee States"

#### What It Actually Does:
- Immediately forces an employee to check-in, check-out, or end breaks
- Used for emergencies when employee can't access the system

#### Step-by-Step Test:
```
1. Have an employee check in normally
2. Go to Force Actions section
3. Select that employee from dropdown
4. Choose "Force Check-out"
5. Add detailed note: "Testing force checkout - employee left sick"
6. Click "Execute Force Action"
7. Employee should immediately show as "Completed" status

8. Test with employee on break:
   - Have employee start a break
   - Force "End All Breaks"
   - Employee should return to "Working" status
```

#### Real-World Example:
**Scenario**: Sarah left sick at 2:30 PM but forgot to check out.
**Solution**:
1. Select Sarah from dropdown
2. Choose "Force Check-out"
3. Add note: "Employee left sick at 2:30 PM, forgot to check out"
4. Execute action - Sarah's day is properly ended at current time

### 3. ‚öôÔ∏è System Settings - "Configure Work Policies"

#### What It Actually Does:
- Sets company-wide rules that affect all employees
- Controls work hours, break limits, overtime calculations

#### Step-by-Step Test:
```
1. Go to System Settings section
2. Note current "Work Start Time" (probably 09:00)
3. Change it to 10:00
4. Change "Break Duration Limit" to 90 minutes
5. Click "Save All Settings"
6. Should see success message

7. Test the effect:
   - Have employee check in at 9:30 AM
   - System should now consider this "early" (before 10:00 start)
   - Break warnings should trigger at 90 minutes instead of 60
```

#### Real-World Example:
**Scenario**: Company switches to 10 AM start time for winter months.
**Solution**:
1. Change "Work Start Time" to 10:00
2. Adjust "Auto Check-out Time" to 19:00 (9 PM)
3. Save settings - all employees now follow new schedule

### 4. üìã All Records - "View and Manage All Data"

#### What It Actually Does:
- Shows filtered view of all attendance records
- Provides data for bulk operations
- Allows detailed filtering and searching

#### Step-by-Step Test:
```
1. Go to All Records section
2. Test different filters:
   - Set date range to "last 30 days"
   - Select specific employee
   - Choose status "completed"
   - Set limit to 50 records

3. Click "Apply Filters & Search"
4. Should see filtered results
5. Test selection:
   - Check "Select All" checkbox
   - Counter should update
   - Individual checkboxes should all be checked

6. Test with no results:
   - Set impossible date range (future dates)
   - Should show "No Records Found" message
```

#### Real-World Example:
**Scenario**: Need to see all incomplete work days from last month for payroll review.
**Solution**:
1. Set date range to last month
2. Set status to "not_started"
3. Apply filters - shows all days employees forgot to check in

### 5. üîç Audit Trail - "Track All Admin Actions"

#### What It Actually Does:
- Shows permanent log of every administrative action
- Provides transparency and compliance tracking
- Cannot be deleted or modified

#### Step-by-Step Test:
```
1. First, perform some admin actions:
   - Force an employee action
   - Bulk edit some records
   - Change system settings

2. Go to Audit Trail section
3. Should see your recent actions listed
4. Each entry shows:
   - What action was performed
   - Who performed it (your admin name)
   - When it happened
   - What data was changed

5. Look for these action types:
   - "force_check_out" from your force action test
   - "bulk_edit" from your bulk operations test
   - "update_system_settings" from settings test
```

#### Real-World Example:
**Scenario**: Employee disputes their hours were changed incorrectly.
**Solution**:
1. Go to Audit Trail
2. Search for actions on that employee's records
3. Show them exactly what was changed, when, and why
4. Full transparency and legal compliance

## üö® Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "No Records Selected" in Bulk Operations
**Solution**: Go to "All Records" first, load data with filters, then return to Bulk Operations

### Issue: Force Actions not working
**Check**: 
- Employee and action are both selected
- Administrative notes are filled in (required)
- Employee exists and is active

### Issue: System Settings not saving
**Check**:
- You're logged in as admin (not regular employee)
- Settings have valid values (times in correct format)
- Network connection is stable

### Issue: Audit Trail shows "No Logs"
**Solution**: Perform some admin actions first - audit trail only shows actual administrative changes
