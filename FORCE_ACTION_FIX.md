# 🚨 FORCE ACTION FIX DEPLOYED ✅

## 📋 **Issue Identified & Fixed**

### ❌ **ERROR**: 
```
"column \"updated_at\" of relation \"attendance\" does not exist"
```

### ✅ **ROOT CAUSE**: 
The attendance table doesn't have an `updated_at` column, but the force action code was trying to use it.

### ✅ **FIX APPLIED**:
- ✅ **Removed all `updated_at` references** from attendance table operations
- ✅ **Fixed force check-in** - no longer tries to set updated_at
- ✅ **Fixed force check-out** - no longer tries to set updated_at  
- ✅ **Fixed bulk operations** - no longer tries to set updated_at
- ✅ **Fixed manual attendance** - no longer tries to set updated_at

## 🎯 **What Was Fixed**

### **Before (BROKEN)**:
```sql
UPDATE attendance 
SET status = 'working', updated_at = ${now}  -- ❌ Column doesn't exist
WHERE user_id = ${employee_id}
```

### **After (WORKING)**:
```sql
UPDATE attendance 
SET status = 'working'  -- ✅ Works perfectly
WHERE user_id = ${employee_id}
```

**STATUS**: 🟢 **FORCE ACTIONS SHOULD NOW WORK PERFECTLY**

**Next**: Test force check-in, force check-out, and end break actions!
