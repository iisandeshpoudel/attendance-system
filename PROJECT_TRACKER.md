## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Architecture Decisions

### Frontend Stack ✅
- **React 18 + Vite** - Fast development, modern React features
- **Tailwind CSS v3.4.0** - Utility-first styling with custom glassmorphism extensions
- **Premium Glassmorphism Design** - Ultra-modern translucent UI with deep purple luxury theme
- **Enhanced Purple Palette** - Rich purple gradients (#3b0764 → #a855f7 → #c084fc)
- **Context API** - Global state management for auth and attendance

### Backend Stack ✅
- **Vercel Serverless Functions** - Zero-config deployment, auto-scaling
- **Neon PostgreSQL** - Serverless PostgreSQL database
- **JWT Authentication** - Stateless auth with 24h expiration
- **bcryptjs** - Password hashing with 12 rounds

### 🎨 **Premium Design System Choices**

#### **Glassmorphism Enhancement**
- **Ultra-deep background**: Multi-layer purple gradient with fixed attachment
- **Enhanced blur effects**: 20px+ backdrop blur with brightness/saturation filters
- **Luxury shadows**: Multi-layered shadows with purple glows and inset highlights
- **Translucent components**: Variable opacity glass effects (4% to 12% white overlay)
- **Premium animations**: Floating effects, smooth transitions, and hover transformations
- **🆕 Compact Design**: Smaller, more refined components with reduced padding
- **🆕 Enhanced Responsiveness**: Mobile-first design with smooth breakpoint transitions

#### **Purple Luxury Theme Rationale**
- **Professional Authority**: Deep purples convey leadership and premium quality
- **Modern Sophistication**: Aligns with contemporary enterprise software aesthetics
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Rich purple gradients create clear focus points
- **Brand Differentiation**: Stands out from typical blue/gray corporate applications
- **User Experience**: Purple is associated with creativity and innovation

#### **Advanced UI Components**
- **Glass Cards**: Multi-layered transparency with edge lighting effects
- **Gradient Text**: Dynamic purple gradients for headings and highlights
- **Status Indicators**: Glowing orbs with color-coded shadows
- **Floating Elements**: Subtle hover animations with depth perception

### Key Architectural Decisions
1. **Serverless Architecture**: Chose Vercel functions over traditional server for simplicity and scalability
2. **JWT Over Sessions**: Stateless auth works better with serverless functions
3. **PostgreSQL Over NoSQL**: Relational data structure fits attendance tracking perfectly
4. **Monorepo Structure**: Frontend and API in same repository for easier deployment
5. **API Utils in Both Directories**: Duplicated utils in `api/utils/` and `src/utils/` due to Vercel import limitations
6. **🎨 Premium Glassmorphism**: Chosen for luxury feel and modern user experience
7. **🎨 Purple Theme Strategy**: Selected for professional authority and visual differentiation
8. **🆕 Compact Design Philosophy**: Smaller components for better usability and modern aesthetics

## ⚠️ Known Considerations & Constraints

### Technical Constraints
- **Vercel Function Limits**: 12-function limit on Hobby plan (currently using 9)
- **Database Connections**: Neon has connection limits on free tier
- **File Size**: Large CSV exports might hit Vercel limits
- **Real-time**: No WebSocket support, using polling for real-time updates
- **🎨 Browser Support**: Advanced glassmorphism requires modern browsers (Safari 14+, Chrome 76+)
- **🆕 Mobile Performance**: Careful optimization needed for complex glassmorphism on older devices

### Business Logic Decisions
- **Daily Attendance**: One record per user per day (enforced by UNIQUE constraint)
- **Break Tracking**: Multiple breaks allowed, time subtracted from total hours
- **Timezone**: All times stored in UTC, displayed in user's local timezone
- **Data Retention**: No automatic deletion, admin manages data lifecycle

### Security Considerations
- **JWT Expiration**: 24-hour token lifetime
- **Password Policy**: Minimum 6 characters, bcrypt hashing
- **Role-based Access**: Separate endpoints for admin vs employee functions
- **Input Validation**: Both client and server-side validation

### **🎨 Design Considerations**
- **Performance**: CSS-only animations for optimal performance
- **Accessibility**: Maintained contrast ratios despite translucent effects
- **Browser Compatibility**: Graceful degradation for older browsers
- **Mobile Experience**: Responsive glassmorphism that works on all devices
- **🆕 Screen Density**: Optimized for various DPI and screen sizes
