# 📋 Attendance System - Project Tracker

## 🎯 Project Overview
**Remote Employee Attendance Tracking System for 15 Employees**

- Admin dashboard for employee monitoring
- CSV export and reporting capabilities
- Beautiful glassmorphism UI with dark theme
- Production-ready deployment on Vercel

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Architecture Decisions

### Frontend Stack ✅
- **React 18 + Vite** - Fast development, modern React features
- **Tailwind CSS v3.4.0** - Utility-first styling (downgraded from v4 due to PostCSS issues)
- **Glassmorphism Design** - Modern glass-like UI with purple accents (#8b5cf6, #7c3aed, #6d28d9)
- **Context API** - Global state management for auth and attendance

### Backend Stack ✅
- **Vercel Serverless Functions** - Zero-config deployment, auto-scaling
- **Neon PostgreSQL** - Serverless PostgreSQL database
- **JWT Authentication** - Stateless auth with 24h expiration
- **bcryptjs** - Password hashing with 12 rounds

### Key Architectural Decisions
1. **Serverless Architecture**: Chose Vercel functions over traditional server for simplicity and scalability
2. **JWT Over Sessions**: Stateless auth works better with serverless functions
3. **PostgreSQL Over NoSQL**: Relational data structure fits attendance tracking perfectly
4. **Monorepo Structure**: Frontend and API in same repository for easier deployment
5. **API Utils in Both Directories**: Duplicated utils in `api/utils/` and `src/utils/` due to Vercel import limitations

## 🎨 Design System Guidelines

### Color Palette (Consistent Usage)
- **Primary Purple**: #8b5cf6 (main actions, highlights)
- **Secondary Purple**: #7c3aed (hover states)
- **Dark Purple**: #6d28d9 (active states)
- **Background Gradient**: #1e1b4b → #312e81 → #1e1b4b
- **Glass Effects**: bg-white/10, backdrop-blur-md, border-white/20

### Component Standards
- **Glass Cards**: `.glass-card` class for consistent styling

## 🔧 Technical Issues Resolved

### Major Issues Fixed
1. **Tailwind CSS v4 Compatibility**: Downgraded to v3.4.0 due to PostCSS plugin issues
2. **Vercel Import Paths**: Created duplicate utils in `api/utils/` for serverless functions
3. **Neon Database API**: Updated to use `sql.query()` for parameterized queries
4. **CORS Configuration**: Resolved cross-origin issues with custom domain
5. **Environment Variables**: Properly configured in Vercel dashboard
6. **Vercel Function Limits**: Optimized to 9 functions (removed test.js, db-status.js)

### Critical Discoveries
- Vercel serverless functions can't import from `src/` directory
- Neon driver API changed to require `sql.query()` for parameterized queries
- Custom domain requires matching VITE_API_URL environment variable
- Vercel Hobby plan limited to 12 serverless functions

## ⚠️ Known Considerations & Constraints

### Technical Constraints
- **Vercel Function Limits**: 12-function limit on Hobby plan (currently using 9)
- **Database Connections**: Neon has connection limits on free tier
- **File Size**: Large CSV exports might hit Vercel limits
- **Real-time**: No WebSocket support, using polling for real-time updates

### Business Logic Decisions
- **Daily Attendance**: One record per user per day (enforced by UNIQUE constraint)
- **Break Tracking**: Multiple breaks allowed, time subtracted from total hours
- **Timezone**: All times stored in UTC, displayed in user's local timezone
- **Data Retention**: No automatic deletion, admin manages data lifecycle

### Security Considerations
- **JWT Expiration**: 24-hour token lifetime
- **Password Policy**: Minimum 6 characters, bcrypt hashing
- **Role-based Access**: Separate endpoints for admin vs employee functions
- **Input Validation**: Both client and server-side validation
