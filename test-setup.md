# 🧪 Testing Your Attendance System

## ✅ PostCSS Issue Fixed!

The Tailwind CSS PostCSS configuration has been updated and the development server should now be running without errors.

## 🚀 Quick Test Steps

### 1. **Verify Server is Running**
- Open your browser and go to: `http://localhost:5173`
- You should see the login page with glassmorphism design

### 2. **Test Authentication**
- Use the demo admin credentials:
  - **Email**: `admin@company.com`
  - **Password**: `admin123`

### 3. **Test Employee Dashboard** (Admin will see admin dashboard, but you can test employee features by creating an employee user)

## 🔧 Environment Setup Required

Before testing the full functionality, you need to:

### 1. **Create Environment File**
```bash
cp env.example .env
```

### 2. **Set Up Neon Database**
1. Go to [Neon.tech](https://neon.tech) and create a free account
2. Create a new database
3. Copy the connection string
4. Run the SQL from `database-schema.sql` in your Neon console

### 3. **Update .env File**
```env
NEON_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@hostname/database?sslmode=require
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-minimum-32-characters
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5173
```

## 🎯 What You Can Test Now

### ✅ **Frontend (Without Database)**
- Login page design and validation
- Responsive glassmorphism UI
- Form interactions and loading states

### ✅ **Full System (With Database)**
- Complete authentication flow
- Employee check-in/out functionality
- Real-time time tracking
- Notes system
- Admin dashboard (basic)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If you see PostCSS errors:
- The configuration has been fixed
- Restart the dev server: `npm run dev`

### If you see database errors:
- Make sure your `.env` file is configured
- Verify your Neon DB connection string
- Run the database schema from `database-schema.sql`

### If you see CORS errors:
- Make sure `VITE_API_URL` in `.env` matches your dev server URL
- Default should be: `http://localhost:5173`

## 🎉 Ready for Phase 3!

Once you've tested the employee interface, we can proceed to build:
- **Admin Dashboard** with employee monitoring
- **Reports and Analytics**
- **CSV Export functionality**
- **User Management**

The foundation is solid and ready for the next phase!
